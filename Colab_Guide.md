# Colab Guide

The reporting makes use of Google Earth Engine and Google Drive. Therefore it is convenient
to run the code in the Google Colab environment. This environment already has most
of the required libraries installed so users are able to get up and running
quickly.

There is, however, some amount of user-configuration required and this guide
is intended to walk users through the necessary steps.

## Clone Repository

To use Colab

repo_url = 'https://github.com/datasciencecampus/sdg_661_analysis_and_reporting.git'
